In order to make the graph laplacian matrix invertible, add a small perturbation to the first diagonal entry of $L_s$ , namely $L_s (1, 1) = L_s (1, 1) + 0.2$. Export Ls in the *.mtx* format and move it to the `lis-2.1.10/test` folder. Using the proper iterative solver available in the LIS library compute the largest eigenvalue of Ls up to a tolerance of $10^{âˆ’8}$. Report the computed eigenvalue and the iterations counts.

Since the largest eigenvalue is requested, it is possible to apply the power method. This can be achieve by the LIS command: 
```
mpirun -n 4 ./eigen1 Ls_perturbed.mtx eigvec.txt hist.txt -e pi -etol 1.e-8 -emaxiter 3000
```
whose console output is: 
```
